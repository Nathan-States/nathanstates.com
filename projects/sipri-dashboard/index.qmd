## SIPRI Dashboard 

This web application allows users to view military spending across the world using several different metrics, including:

* **Converted USD** 
* **Inflation-Adjusted USD** 
* **Military Spending in GDP Percentage** 
* **Military Spending in Government Percentage**
* **Military Spending in Capita Spending** 

You can view the dashboard by clicking [here](https://nathan-states.shinyapps.io/sipri-dashboard/). 

## Data Source 

The data comes from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute ([SIPRI](https://sipri.org/)), a think tank that researches conflict, armaments, arms control, and disarmament around the world. SIPRI was created by the [Swedish Parliament](https://sipri.org/about/history) in July 1966, who gives them an annual grant to fund their operations. They also receive funding from a variety of other governments and NGOs, including the EU, Australian Government, the University of Notre Dame, the Norwegian Ministry, [and many more](https://sipri.org/about/funding-2021). 

You can download the database used for this project [here](https://milex.sipri.org/sipri).
