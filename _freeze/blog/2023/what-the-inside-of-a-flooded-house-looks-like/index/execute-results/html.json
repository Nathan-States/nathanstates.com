It's just kind of a chore, going from looking at one screen for 8 hours to looking at another one long enough to not procrastinate indefinitely to the point I end up accomplishing nothing at all.\n\nToday, my six April viewers, will be a little more personal. I've had these photos saved to my desktop for about seven months now, and I've been meaning to get rid of them. What better way to solve both problems then to share my suffering digitally. \n\n## Ian \n\nI remember lying on my bed, reading on my Chromebook, when the first waves started smashing against the doors. We had some extra mops in case there was any water damage, which... yeah. When I say \"we,\" it was my Dad, my dog Wyatt, and myself. By this point, a strategic decision was made that the only thing we could do was prioritize saving as many valuables as we could. As a result, I don't have any pictures/videos of the flood as it was increasing, but luckily, I do have some pictures at it's absolute worst. \n\n<center>\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](_images/ian_1.jpg){width=1024}\n:::\n:::\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\n<center>\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](_images/ian_2.jpg){width=1024}\n:::\n:::\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\n<center>\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](_images/ian_3.jpg){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\n<center>\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](_images/ian_4.jpg){width=1024}\n:::\n:::\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\nOh yeah, I block out stickers on my overturned refrigerator cause I'm overly paranoid. \n\n## After the Storm \n\nThe FEMA inspector who came to inspect our house said the water level reached about 46 inches. We ended up going back the next day to check the damage. \n\n<center>\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](_images/after_1.jpg){width=1024}\n:::\n:::\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\n<center>\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](_images/after_2.jpg){width=1024}\n:::\n:::\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\n<center>\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](_images/after_3.jpg){width=1024}\n:::\n:::\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\n<center>\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](_images/after_4.jpg){width=1536}\n:::\n:::\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\nInvasive fucks ðŸ¦Ž \n\nPictures of the outside: \n\n<center>\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](_images/irma_outside_1.jpg){width=1536}\n:::\n:::\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\n<center>\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](_images/irma_outside_2.jpg){width=1536}\n:::\n:::\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\n<center>\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](_images/irma_outside_3.jpg){width=1024}\n:::\n:::\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\nThanks for reading. My next post will be a major update and will undoubtedly be much more depressing than this post. Stay tuned. \n",
