Fines are broken down into two categories; regular fines, which can range from; \n\n> (A) not more than **\\$100,000** for a natural person or **\\$2,000,000** for any other person; and \n> (B) in any case to which **paragraph (5)** applies, not more than **\\$750,000** for a natural person or **\\$15,000,000** for any other person;\n\nParagraph (5) refers to more serious violations, and are characterized by;\n\n> (A) **intentional or knowing conduct**, including *reckless conduct*, that results in violation of the applicable statutory, regulatory, or professional standard; *or*\n> (B) **repeated instances of negligent conduct**, each resulting in a violation of the applicable statutory, regulatory, or professional standard. \n\nThe PCAOB serves under the SEC, which means the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Improvements Act of 2015 also applies to the board. This [Act](https://www.sec.gov/rules/other/2022/33-11021.pdf) adjusts monetary fines for inflation, which means maximum penalties are actually about 40% higher than the amounts listed above. \n\n\nI've broken the tables down between domestic and international sanctions. Once again, scroll down to the table if you don't care about code, but for those who do;\n\n**Setup**: Again, we import the libraries we need, along with the data. \n\n```{r setup, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n# Import Libraries \nlibrary(arrow)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggiraph)\nlibrary(htmltools)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(gtExtras)\n\n# Load Data \nenforcement <- read_csv_arrow(\"_data/enforcement.csv\")\ndomestic_overview <- read_csv_arrow(\"_data/domestic_overview.csv\")\ninternational_overview <- read_csv_arrow(\"_data/international_overview.csv\")\n```\n\n**Data Wrangling**: Here, we calculate totals against both domestic and international firms, broken down between sanctions against firms, and sanctions against auditors.

Much of this comes from a *Deloitte Brazil* affiliate who was fined [\\$8,000,000 in 2016](https://pcaobus.org/news-events/news-releases/news-release-detail/pcaob-announces-8-million-settlement-with-deloitte-brazil-for-violations-including-issuing-materially-false-audit-reports-and-12-individuals-also-sanctioned-for-various-violations_601), and [three recent sanctions](https://pcaobus.org/news-events/news-releases/news-release-detail/imposing-7-7-million-in-fines-pcaob-sanctions-three-firms-four-individuals-kpmg-global-network) against KPMG firms adding up to \\$7.7 million. International Deloitte and KPMG firms make up the majority of total PCAOB fines. \n\nIt's strange that a regulator based out of the United States would spend most of its time disciplining their international affiliates, but even stranger is the PCAOB's focus on small, domestic firms. While the eight largest firms (especially the Big Four) audit most of the companies in the US, including all of the largest ones, they receive extremely few sanctions, though they are much harsher on average. Still, the disparity is so large that, in total, firms outside the top eight have been fined the most of any group, especially against auditors. \n\nIf you've read the last post, you'll remember that large firms have to undergo annual inspections, where the PCAOB will investigate to see if an audit was performed properly or not. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect firms who perform worse on inspections would be more likely to receive sanctions, but that clearly isn't the case.me firms, such as KPMG and BDO, have *never* been sanctioned domestically despite KPMG having the worse deficiency rate among the top four, and BDO's nearly 50% deficiency rate. For reference, the PCAOB fined BDO's Hungary affiliate \\$20,000 for failing to disclose relevant information about the relationship they had with the company they were auditing (though the audits in question were conducted properly). \n\nEven if they had chose to, the amounts as a whole are fairly low. Cumulatively, the four largest firms have been fined more than \\$1 billion by the SEC \n\nIf you remember from our first section, the PCAOB issues annual investigation reports for each of the largest firms, and one would expect that firms who perform worse on these investigations would be more likely to be fined. \n\nA quick glance at the tables shows this is almost entirely not the case. Despite both KPMG and BDO performing the worse on inspection reports among their domestic affiliates, they've been sanctioned the least among the eight largest domestic firms. In fact, neither domestic firm has been fined a *single* time in PCAOB history. \n\nOutside of performance, we'd expect enforcement to be skewed towards the largest firms due to their size. If the largest firms are auditing most the companies, it would be logical to think they'd also get most of the enforcement. The PCAOB seemingly has other ideas. Grant Thornton, who recorded a 1/6 of the revenue of KPMG in 2022, has been fined \\$2,250,000 by the board, the second most of any domestic firm - and all while having a much lower deficiency rate of ___ compared to ___ of KPMG. \n\nIn total, while the eight largest firms have been sanctioned 8 times for \\$8,765,000, everyone else has been sanctioned 193 times for \\$2,767,500. So while larger firms receive harsher fines, the PCAOB is clearly focused on smaller firms. Specifically, 70 of those sanctions were against sole proprietors, with most cases involving penny stocks. \n\nSanctions against international affiliates looks much different comparatively. Deloitte and KPMG have been absolutely hammered on the international stage, though most of these fines are the result of single incidents. In 2016, Deloitte was fined \\$8 million regarding its audit work of the Brazilian *GOL* airlines that also included 12 auditors receiving sanctions. Recently, on 12/06/22, the PCAOB went on a rampage against KPMG, sanctioning four international affiliates for a total of \\$6.8 million. \n\nIt's interesting that the PCAOB would target international affiliates so aggressively considering that they are much less important than their domestic counterparts. It could be argued that it's because the international affiliates perform worse, but that logic doesn't seem to apply to KPMG and BDO at all. As a result, it's hard to look at PCAOB enforcement as anything other than arbitrary and random. \n\nMore fundamentally, if the board can fine firms over \\$15 million for \"repeated instances of negligent conduct\", why are the amounts so low given such high deficiency rates? If BDO can fail almost half of their audit inspections and not be subjected to a single fine, or if KPMG can fail a third of their audits while also trying to cheat PCAOB investigations which eventually gets them [sanctioned by the SEC for \\$50 million](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2019-95) - what the hell does \"repeated instances of negligent conduct\" *really* mean? \n\n## Enforcement Through Time \n\n```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=11, fig.align='center', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n#| column: screen\nenforcement |>\n  dplyr::mutate(date = lubridate::mdy(date)) |>\n  dplyr::mutate(date = substring(date, 1, 4)) |>\n  dplyr::mutate(date = factor(date)) |>\n  dplyr::group_by(date, location) |>\n  summarise(total = n()) |>\n  mutate(date = as.numeric(as.character(date))) |>\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_col(\n    aes(x = date, y = total, fill = location),\n    width = 1,\n    color = \"#212124\"\n  ) + \n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = date , y = total, label = total, group = location),\n    position = position_stack(vjust = .56),\n    color = \"#fcfcff\",\n    family = \"1955\",\n    fontface = \"bold\", \n    size = 5.25\n  ) + \n  annotate(\n    \"segment\",\n    x = 2014.5,\n    xend = 2017.5,\n    y = 80,\n    yend = 80,\n    color = \"#44444a\",\n    size = 1.1,\n    alpha = .8\n  ) + \n  annotate(\n    \"segment\",\n    x = 2014.5,\n    xend = 2014.5,\n    y = 80,\n    yend = 79.5,\n    color = \"#44444a\",\n    size = 1.1,\n    alpha = .8\n  ) + \n  annotate(\n    \"segment\",\n    x = 2017.5,\n    xend = 2017.5,\n    y = 80,\n    yend = 79.5,\n    color = \"#44444a\",\n    size = 1.1,\n    alpha = .8\n  ) + \n  annotate(\n    \"segment\",\n    x = 2010.3,\n    xend = 2014.3,\n    y = 62,\n    yend = 78,\n    linetype = \"dotted\", \n    color = \"#44444a\",\n    size = 0.7\n  ) + \n  annotate(\n    \"text\",\n    x = 2010,\n    y = 58.5,\n    size = 3.2,\n    color = \"#212124\",\n    family = \"1955\",\n    label = \"40.7% of Enforcements\"\n  ) +\n    annotate(\n    \"text\",\n    x = 2010,\n    y = 54.5,\n    size = 3.2,\n    color = \"#212124\",\n    family = \"1955\",\n    label = \"Occured During 2015-2017\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    expand = c(0, 0),\n    breaks = seq(2005, 2022, by = 1)\n  ) + \n  scale_y_continuous(\n    expand = c(0, 0),\n    limits = c(0, 85)\n  ) + \n  labs(\n    x = \"\", y = \"\",\n    title=\"Number of PCAOB Sanctions by Year\",\n    subtitle = \"The number of PCAOB enforcement actions has been very inconsistent from year to year, with their first sanction given three years after the board's <br> creation.

Without getting too much into the details, in 2010, a case titled *Free Enterprise Fund vs. PCAOB* was brought to the Supreme Court that challenged the constitutionality of the board. While it did not pass, the Supreme Court did rule that the provision that PCAOB board members could only be removed \"for just cause only\" was unconstitutional and struct it down. What this means in practical terms is that once a new administration is in office, they'll usually remove all the board members and hire a new one, and each iteration of the board clearly has its own interpretation of enforcement. \n\nJames Doty was PCAOB Chairman from 2011 - 2017, and during his last three years, he decided to go on a tear, sanctioning over 200 firms/auditors, which makes up over 40% of all PCAOB sanctions. In [February 2018](https://www.complianceweek.com/sec-appoints-all-new-board-to-lead-pcaob-in-2018/8970.article), an entire new board was elected, and sanctions fell by about half the following years. In a PCAOB Webinar hosted for audit committee members, newly elected Chairman Bill Duhnke stated that the board had \"discovered from feedback\" that;\n\n> \"The PCAOB wasn't necessarily playing well with others, that it was rarely receptive to feedback from stakeholders [...] **Consequently we've been actively trying to change that** [...] \n> \n> -- Bill Duhnke, [quote at 1:38](https://youtu.be/it8ZNcqplBM?t=98)\n\nThe [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-investigating-former-chair-of-auditing-industry-regulator-11623943373) would report in October 2019 that the board had \"slowed its work amid board infighting, multiple senior staff departures, and allegations that the chairman has created a 'sense of fear' according to a [May 2019] whistle-blower letter and people familiar with the situation.\" Dunkhe would later be investigated by the SEC for his handling of internal complaints and employee harassment, which eventually led Dunkhe and the entire board [getting canned in 2021](https://www.winston.com/en/capital-markets-and-securities-law-watch/sec-investigates-pcaob-chairman-and-removes-entire-board.html) (though that didn't stop him from [returning to Capitol Hill](https://news.bloombergtax.com/financial-accounting/fired-audit-board-chief-returns-to-capitol-hill-as-senate-aide) as a Senate Aide).\n\nUnder the new leadership of Chairman Erica Williams, the total number of sanctions has stayed mostly the same, though they do differ in a unique way. Prior to 2015, only 35.51% of sanctions involved a monetary fine; under Dunkhe, that number was to 65.74%. Under Williams, all sanctions have involved a monetary penalty outside of two incidents. In both those [reports](https://pcaob-assets.azureedge.net/pcaob-dev/docs/default-source/enforcement/decisions/documents/105-2022-036-ramirez.pdf?sfvrsn=752cf0c0_4), they state they \"would have imposed a civil money penalty of \\$25,000\" had they not \"taken [their] financial resources into consideration.\" \n\nI'd imagine in 2024, if a Republican administration is in control of the White House, there is an extremely high likelihood that they will announce a brand new board, just like past administrations have done. With that will come a new and slightly different enforcement policy. \n\n## Small Fries \n\n- chart -\n\nKind of. The PCAOB still mostly loves picking on small audit firms, especially sole proprietors. Granted, these are not small mom-and-pop shops; to be able to audit a publicly traded company all by yourself requires some reputation. A lot of these cases involve penny stocks in which the auditors - either directly or indirectly - had something to gain from the company's valuation. Over the last few years, the number of penny stocks on the market has [risen significantly](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/business/penny-stocks-trading.html), so we can expect more auditors to be fined in the future. \n\nTo return to an earlier question; why is the PCAOB focused so much more on smaller firms, compared to multinational firms who have a massive impact on the global economy? There's a whole bunch of reasons why, but one I'd like to draw attention to are **budgetary restrictions**.  \n\n## All Enforcement Actions \n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n#| column: page\nenforcement |>\n  select(country, date, parent_company, fine, link) |>\n  arrange(desc(fine)) |>\n  reactable(\n    columns = list(\n      country = colDef(name = \"Country\"),\n      parent_company = colDef(name = \"Parent Company\"),\n      date = colDef(\n        name = \"Date\",\n        format = colFormat(date = TRUE, locales = \"en-US\")\n      ),\n      fine = colDef(\n        name = \"Fine\",\n        format = colFormat(prefix = \"$\", separators = TRUE, digits = 0)\n      ),\n      link = colDef(name = \"Link\")\n    )\n  )\n```\n\n<br>\n\nAnd here's all PCAOB enforcement actions since 12/22/2022. \n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../assets/styles.css"],"highlight-style":{"light":"../../../assets/syntax-light.theme","dark":"../../../assets/syntax-dark.theme"},"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"code-summary":"Show code"},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","editor":"source","theme":{"light":"../../../assets/states-light.scss","dark":"../../../assets/states-dark.scss"},"smooth-scroll":true,"code-block-border-left":true,"title-block-banner":true,"title":"Analyzing 20 Years of PCAOB Data: Part 2 (Enforcement)","description":"The PCAOB can fine firms as much as $15 million for infractions, but how often are they really disciplined?","date":"2023-02-01","categories":["pcaob","government"],"image":"thumbnail.png","draft":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
