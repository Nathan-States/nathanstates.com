SIPRI was created by the [Swedish Parliament](https://sipri.org/about/history) in July 1966, who gives them an annual grant to fund their operations. They also receive funding from a variety of other governments and NGOs, including the EU, Australian Government, the University of Notre Dame, the Norwegian Ministry, [and many more](https://sipri.org/about/funding-2021). \n\nYou can download the database used for this project [here](https://milex.sipri.org/sipri).\n\n### Photo Credit \n\nPhoto by [Juli Kosolapova](https://unsplash.com/@yuli_superson). \n\n### Sidenote \n\nThis application is currently being hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) on a free plan. Performance can sometimes be slow, and applications are limited to 25 active hours a month. It's possible to download the source code and launch the app locally to avoid those issues.\n",
